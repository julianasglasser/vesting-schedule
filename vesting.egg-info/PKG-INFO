Description: # Vesting Schedule CL
        
        This a command-line program that reads a file of vesting events and outputs a vesting schedule to `stdout`.
        
        ## How to set up
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## How to run
        
        Along with the command to run, you should input at `stdin` two arguments. The first is the `filename` (including relative path when not in the same folder) and the second is a `target date`, which is the last date of interest.
        
        ```bash
        python3 vesting.py [filename.csv] [YYYY-MM-DD]
        ```
        
        **OR**
        
        ```bash
        ./vesting.py [filename.csv] [YYYY-MM-DD]
        ```
        
        ### Example
        
        ```bash
        ./vesting example.csv 2020-01-01
        ```
